        "If a is divisible by p, then \( a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod p \).",
        "If a is not divisible by p, then \( a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod p \).",

      "Explanation": "Fermat’s Little Theorem states that for any integer a and a prime number p, if a is not divisible by p, then \(a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod p\). If a is divisible by p, the result is 0, not 1."
